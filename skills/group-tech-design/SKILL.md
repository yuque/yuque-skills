# Team Tech Design — Technical Design Document Generator (Team)

Help the user write a structured technical design document following a standard template, then save it to the team's Yuque knowledge base for group review.

## When to Use

- User wants to write a technical design document or RFC and save it to the group repo
- User says "帮我写技术方案到团队库", "write a tech design for the team", "团队技术方案"
- User describes a feature/system and needs it formalized into a design doc for group review

## Required MCP Tools

All tools are from the `yuque-mcp` server:

- `yuque_search` — (Optional) Search for related existing docs for context
- `yuque_list_repos` — Find the target group knowledge base
- `yuque_create_doc` — Create the design document

## Reference

The full template is in [references/template.md](./references/template.md). Load it when generating the document.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Understand the Requirements

Gather from the user:

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| 项目/功能名称 | Yes | What is being designed |
| 背景与问题 | Yes | Why this is needed, what problem it solves |
| 目标 | Yes | What success looks like |
| 约束条件 | No | Technical constraints, timeline, budget |
| 已有方案 | No | Any existing approaches or prior art |
| 团队标识 (Group login) | Yes | The team's Yuque group login |

If the user provides a brief description, ask clarifying questions:
- "这个功能要解决什么问题？"
- "有什么技术约束吗？比如必须用某个框架、要兼容现有系统？"
- "预期的时间节点是什么？"

If the user hasn't specified a group login, ask: "请告诉我团队的语雀团队标识（group login），我来把技术方案存到团队知识库。"

### Step 2: (Optional) Search for Context

If relevant, search Yuque for related existing documents:

```
Tool: yuque_search
Parameters:
  query: "<related keywords>"
  type: "doc"
```

This helps:
- Avoid duplicating existing designs
- Reference prior decisions
- Understand the current architecture

### Step 3: Generate the Design Document

Load the template from `references/template.md` and fill in each section based on the user's input and your technical analysis.

Key sections to fill:

1. **背景 (Background)** — Problem statement, current situation
2. **目标 (Goals)** — What this design achieves, non-goals
3. **方案设计 (Design)** — The core technical approach
   - Architecture diagram description (describe in text/ASCII if needed)
   - Core components and their responsibilities
   - Data model / API design
   - Key flows (sequence of operations)
4. **技术选型 (Tech Stack)** — Why specific technologies were chosen
5. **方案对比 (Alternatives)** — Other approaches considered and why they were rejected
6. **排期 (Timeline)** — Milestones and estimated effort
7. **风险评估 (Risks)** — What could go wrong and mitigation strategies
8. **参考资料 (References)** — Related docs, links, prior art

### Step 4: Review with User

Present the draft to the user before saving. Ask:
- "方案内容是否准确？有需要调整的地方吗？"
- "要补充其他技术细节吗？"

### Step 5: Save to Team Yuque

```
Tool: yuque_list_repos
Parameters:
  login: "<group_login>"
  type: "group"
```

Find or ask for the target group repo (often "技术方案" or "设计文档" or "RFC").

```
Tool: yuque_create_doc
Parameters:
  repo_id: "<namespace>"    # e.g., "my-team/tech-docs"
  title: "[技术方案] <项目名称>"
  body: "<formatted design document>"
  format: "markdown"
```

### Step 6: Confirm

```markdown
✅ 技术方案已创建（草稿状态）！

📄 **[[技术方案] 项目名称](文档链接)**
📚 已保存到：「团队知识库名称」

### 文档结构
- 背景与目标
- 方案设计（含 X 个核心模块）
- 技术选型对比
- 排期（预计 X 周）
- 风险评估（X 个风险点）

💡 文档为草稿状态，请团队评审后发布。
```

## Guidelines

- Write the design doc in Chinese (default) unless the user specifies English
- Be specific in the design section — include data models, API signatures, flow descriptions
- For tech stack comparison, use a table with pros/cons
- Keep the document actionable — someone should be able to implement from this doc
- If the user's requirements are vague, make reasonable assumptions and note them clearly with "【假设】" markers
- Don't over-engineer — match the design complexity to the project scope
- Always end the confirmation with "请团队评审后发布" — group designs need review
- This skill saves to group repos — for personal repos, use `personal-tech-design`

## Error Handling

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| User provides very vague requirements | Ask 2-3 targeted questions before generating |
| `yuque_search` finds conflicting existing designs | Mention them and ask user how to reconcile |
| `yuque_create_doc` fails | Show error, offer to output the markdown for manual copy |
| User wants to update an existing design doc | Use `yuque_search` to find it, then suggest creating a v2 or appendix |
| User wants to save to personal repo | Suggest using `personal-tech-design` skill instead |
| Group login not provided | Ask user for the team's group login |
| Team Token not configured | Inform user that group repos require a team-level Token |
